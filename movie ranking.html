   <h2>My Top 3 movies of all time</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Queen</h3>
         <p>One of the movies that fills me with hope and belief in a better tomorrow!<br />The small-town-girl-in-the-big-ole'-city never fails to warm my soul</p>
      <h3>Secretariat</h3>
         <p>Resilience, Tenacity and Perseverance are the three gems that define this cinematic masterpiece.</p>
       <h3>Kimi no nawa</h3>
          <p>Your Name is one of those experiences that linger with you for years after you watch it, like a lifelong companion dangling by your shoulders.<br />The themes of love, friendship, loss, grief and dreams, coupled with the breathtaking animation style and splendid soundtrack by the Radwimps makes this  a non-negotiable pick!<p>
